Thank you for purchasing IFW Normals Script.

For testing it, just drag and drop IFWNormals.mse to your 3dsmax viewport, or click Scripting->Run Script and choose IFWNormals.mse

For installation:
	- Run 3ds max as Administrator
	- click Scripting->Run Script and choose IFWNormals.mzp, restart 3ds max
	- now you can add it to your toolbar, hotkey,... like any other command in "Customize/Customize user interface" menu, under category "Cattomic"

For using it:
	Run the script, select the objects you want and press generate
	You can adjust the threshold angle for coplanar faces to be weighted like one
	If you edit your Poly, change smoothing groups, ... you will need to generate normals again, select the object, and press generate again.
