1) Close 3ds Max.
2) a) Install the Microsoft Visual 2010 C++ Redistributable if you are using 3ds max 2014 or lower.
   b) Install the Microsoft Visual 2015-2019 C++ Redistributable if you are using 3ds max 2015 or higher.
3) Copy the "plugins" folder and the "libiomp5md.dll" file from the folder that matches your 3ds Max version to your 3ds Max installation directory e.g. "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max xxxx"

	!IMPORTANT! - if an "libiomp5md.dll" file already exists in your 3ds Max folder rename the existing file to "libiomp5md.dll.old" and copy the new one; if 3ds Max gives an error at startup delete 
		      the copied file and change the "libiomp5md.dll.old" file back to "libiomp5md.dll", now see it runs without errors

4) Open 3ds Max and look for "Unwrap Pro" in the modifier list.
